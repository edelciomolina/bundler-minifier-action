A Github Action that works like [BundlerMinifier](https://github.com/madskristensen/BundlerMinifier) into Visual Studio.

The use of this Action eliminates the need for using the Bundler Minifier extension and storing minified files within your project. The main functionality of this action is to recreate the entire minification process that would typically be done within Visual Studio, transferring the responsibility to your workflow.
